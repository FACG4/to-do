# to-do app

## Simple to do App
We built our to-do app using TDD. Simple todo list that adds, deletes, marks as read.

## Objectives:
#### Learn TDD and DOM.

## What we learned:

* #### DOM:

  * Creating event listeners.
  * Fetching elements and functions from other files.
  * creating local Storage.

* #### TDD:
  * Create and apply tests.


## Functionality:

### Add elements:
* Inputs todo tasks into a list.
* Prevents Default.
* Trims the input, returns alert if empty.
* Successfully tested.


### Delete elements:
* identifies element by ID.
* deletes using the array.filter() method.
* Successfully tested.

### Mark as done:
* identifies elements by ID.
* marks items using array.map() method instead of for loop.
* successfully tested.


### Problems:
* Duplicate IDs.
